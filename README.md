# Time Is Running:


<h1> User Story </h1>
As an amazing coding boot camp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers and do better, as well as work on my progress. 




<h1> Motivation </h1>
<p> Competitiveness is a great motivator and will aid in deterring procrastination as a bootcamp student. </p>



<h4> Issues </h4>
 <ol>
    <li> Creating a dynamic and new page for each question presented to user. </li>
    <li> Adding input from user to local storage and displaying it back to user. </li>
    <li> Adding scores and removing values to decrement if wrong answer was selected. </li>


<h5> While working through this project it became apparent that I struggle with dynamic element creation. 
I had to get over the fact that we are grabbing and referring to objects and accessing arrays as well as knowing when to look the syntax up. 
This ate a lot of my time and moving forward, I am continuing to practice by creating my own HTMLS/JS files. </h5>
