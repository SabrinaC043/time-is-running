# Time Is Running:


<h1> User Story </h1>
As an amazing coding boot camp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers and do better, as well as work on my progress. 




<h1> Motivation </h1>
<p> Competitiveness is a great motivator and will aid in deterring procrastination as a bootcamp student. </p>



<h4> Issues </h4>
 <ol>
    <li> Creating a dynamic and new page for each question presented to user. </li>
    <li> Adding input from user to local storage and displaying it back to user. </li>
    <li> Adding scores and removing values to decrement if wrong answer was selected. </li>


<h4>  Process<h4>

   <p> I learned that overall, JavaScript is an extremely literal when it comes to coding.

   Familiarizing myself with the flow and speaking the process outloud provided a chance to practice the technical terms.

   Creating the object with arrays, was a great practice to see just how the DRY method can be utilized through dynamic creation of elements.

   Static elements are intended to be kept on the HTML side as long as they are something that the user is always going to see.
   
   When storing the scores to local storage and saving them in a separate file for .js and .html , I understood it as a separation of concern and a way to save the users input for a later point in time.
